# c_07_nested_for

## DESCRIPTION

Print a # block by nesting a for loop in another for loop. If we want to reprezent each of the loops we can say,
that the first loop is iterating through the rows and the second loop is iterating through the columns.

## INSTALL LIBRARIES

The source code uses the cs50 library what you can download [HERE](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50).

To install the cs50 library follow the steps:

1. Open git bash terminal and change the current working directory to `src`:  
   > cd ./libsc50/src

2. Compile the cs50.c source into .o with:
   > gcc -c cs50.c -o cs50.o

3. Make the library archive:  
   > ar rcs libcs50.a cs50.o

4. Copy the `libcs50.a` file into your compiler's `lib` directory

5. Copy the `cs50.h` file into your compiler's `include` directory

## COMPILE AND RUN THE CODE

The code is written in C, the compiler used to generate the exe is: `gcc Rev10, Built by MSYS2 project 12.2.0`

Run the below code in terminal (git bash) to compile the source:

> gcc commandLineArgument.c -lcs50 -o ./build/commandLineArgument

To run the executable run the below code in terminal (git bash):

> ./build/commandLineArgument.exe
